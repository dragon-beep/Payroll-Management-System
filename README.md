# Payroll-Management-System
A company's payroll is the list of employees of that company who are entitled to receive a pay and the amounts that each should receive. Along with the amounts that each employee should receive for time worked or tasks performed, payroll may also refer to a company's records of payments that were previously made to employees, including salaries and wages, bonuses, and withheld taxes, or the company's department that calculates and pays out these amounts.

This project was chosen to replicate an actual payroll management that is often employed in almost every company. We aim to create a basic level payroll system which can easily store and modify employee database and effectively calculate the total salary of employees.

This project provides real life functionalities like adding bonus to the salaries, taking into consideration the number of leaves taken by the employee, and calculating final salary of the employee.
